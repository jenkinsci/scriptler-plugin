title=Create a new Groovy script
intro=\
  Type in an arbitrary <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Home" target="_blank">Groovy script</a> and \
  and save it. Later you will be able to execute it on any slave/node. Useful for trouble-shooting and diagnostics. \
  Use the ''println'' command to see the output (if you use <tt>System.out</tt>, \
  it will go to the server''s stdout, which is harder to see.). If you think your script might be useful to others too, please share it on <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-scripts" target="_blank">https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-scripts</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://scriptlerweb.appspot.com">scriptler web</a>.
