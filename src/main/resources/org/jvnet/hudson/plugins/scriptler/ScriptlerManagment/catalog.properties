 Just  click the save icon and the script will be imported to your local script directory. Depending on the catalog, you can share your scripts too \
 - e.g. <a href="http://scriptlerweb.appspot.com" target="_blank">scriptlerweb</a> allows you to upload your scripts, go on, share some of your scripts too :)
